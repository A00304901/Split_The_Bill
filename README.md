# Split_The_Bill

First, I have a made a repository and inside of them I have created sln file, class library and test file.

And then, I have inserted three methods in class library and written the logic.

My methods has been build successfully.

In the next step, I have created first test cases for first method and i am getting passed the test. woohoo!!!

I  am not getting another test cases passed, I have tried many times and time was not there with me so I uploded how much I have completed.

I am getting the following error:Error Message:
     Error Message:
   CollectionAssert.AreEqual failed. (Element at index 0 do not match.)
